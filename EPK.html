        <h1>VRIAS-</h1>
        <P>-Brings the energy. Nobody else in the DMV is doing anything quite like he is doing. 
            He brings a more personal approach to modern electronic music, but also maintains that 
            high energy thru fast paced, hard hitting drums and classic bass lines. Since 2016, 
            he's been actively producing and has never been hesitant to explore genres ranging from 
            heavy, headbanging bass music to experimental, distorted underground music with influences ranging from rap to 
            electronic music. Branden's whole vibe could be described as: old but new. Obsessing over the 2010 sound of electronic music,
            but being unable to ignore the current and constant evolving state of it, gives life to the perfect 
            combination of a vintage and familiar sound beatifully and carefully fused with the new methods stemming from 
            emerging artists in the electronic music scene. Versatility is a philosophy Branden abides by religously. 
            Limiting one self to a certain avenue of creativity goes against what Branden stands for. Among electronic music, 
            he also is fascinated by underground experimental scenes and incorporates that into his own music time and time again. 
            Branden never tires of looking for inspiration, wherever he may find it. Although primarily a DJ, he has 
            tailored his voice to fit his beats and performs as a vocalist as well. Branden doesn't care much about 
            trying to sound like everybody else. The entire point of creating art (for him at least) is to HAVE FUN. 
            Stressing about if a song sounds right to fit a scene to the extent of not dropping it, is not what he stands for.
            If it sounds good, DROP IT. He's no stranger to being on stage, as he has been since his early years. 
            Whether he's behind a pair of decks or running Ableton on his mac, with his high-energy-filled performances, 
            he is readily equipped to make a lasting impression on the crowd.</P>
